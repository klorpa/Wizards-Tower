::Enter Tower
The inside of the tower is so large that it can only be explained by magic. This floor of the tower has clouds in what has to be a fake sky and the surrounding area appears to be a swamp, with dense forests and more water than land. There's even the illusion of sunlight. Directly behind you, stone walls and the gate confirm that you are indeed inside The Tower.

Off in the distance, you see a town through the trees.
